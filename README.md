# SIT724
Project working with the crazyflie drone


This repository contains the working code for my unit SIT724. I am working with the crazyflie drone 2.1 where I do obstacle detection and handling while the drone is stationary and while it is roaming in an open space in a secured indoor environment.

Below here is a link to all the video demonstrations
1. Stationary: Where the drone hovers to the set height and waits till the code is terminated. When the obstacle is encountered, it handles it by moving away.

2. Roaming: Initially showing how the drone moves in one direction for certain period if no obstacle detected. this goes on if there is no obstacle. Next I put a obstacle on its path. Once detected, the drone changes the direction and moves in a different random direction.
